This directory contains the backend work for the project.
It is used as python virtual environment on the development machine, we isolate packages using this.
If you haven't worked with virtual environments before check this out: (primer)[https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/]
You can still work using your system packages, but why would you do that?
Use requirements.txt to quickly install all the dependencies, but update it if you install anything new.
Get to work!
