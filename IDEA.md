# Styx: File sharing system :rocket:
> This is only a draft. It needs to be reviewed and polished

## The idea
Users on a LAN can send messages and files to each other and set up temporary file sharing servers to move their files from one computer to another.
This will be facilitated by other users who run temporary servers on their device, whom we shall call servers for now, and users who set up a long time server as the backbone of the network, whom we shall call providers for now.

## Pages in the website
1. Login (For the providers and servers)
2. Dashboard-1 (Provider)
3. Dashboard-2 (Server)
4. Hosting manager (Server)
5. Sharing interface (Server and user)
6. Global messaging page
7. Usage documentation and bug reports
8. _Add more if you want to_

## Advantages of using styx 
* It is fast, much faster than sending files over the internet.  
* It is easy to use, thanks to a clean web-interface.  
* No login required for users.
* No strange permissions required, since this is open source, you can edit the source code to your liking.  
* Not bound by location, Unlike other offline file transfer tools, you can be anywhere over the network.  
* Multiplatform, since the main service is provided through a web-browser.  
* Quick fixes, the developers will fix any bugs as soon as possible.
